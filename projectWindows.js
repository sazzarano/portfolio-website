/* 
PSEUDO CODE HERE

allButtons stores all buttons by class, 
added event listener for a click, 
codeWindow will be a variable assignment of pop-up code windows.

/* 
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK

Each button opens a different project window which displays the html, css 
and js of the project within tab buttons. This can be done via a pdf file or 
with another method unknown to me. This window can also be closed via the 
close button on it's corner.
